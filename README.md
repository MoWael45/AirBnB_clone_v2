# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is an implementation of a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. It focuses on creating a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the application.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) for interacting with the AirBnB application. It allows users to create, manage, and manipulate objects within the system using a set of commands.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `./console.py` to start the interpreter.

### How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

- `create`: Create a new instance of a specified class.
- `show`: Display information about a specific instance.
- `destroy`: Remove a specified instance.
- `all`: Display all instances or all instances of a specified class.
- `update`: Update attributes of a specified instance.
